Notes: 
- An 'X' indicates a broken trigger. 
- Pitched percussion are notated 1-9 low to high. 
- If a trigger has a decimal (1.1, 1.2), that means multiple beaters hit the same thing
- The faster you trigger something, the lower the velocity should be 
- Ganapati can auto-shutdown if used too fast with too much velocity. Replug power cable to restart if this happens.
